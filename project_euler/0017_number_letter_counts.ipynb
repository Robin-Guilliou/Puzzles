    "# 17 - Number Letter Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? \n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"note\"><b>NOTE:</b> Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of \"and\" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a mapping counting the number of letters in the words that are often repeated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we simply add each word times the number of times it appears:\n",
    "- 'one thousand' has 11 letters and is seen once.\n",
    "- 'hundred' has 7 letters and is found in 900 numbers (100 to 999). \n",
    "- 'and' has 3 letters and is seen after each hunder except 9 (100, 200, etc)\n",
    "- the numbers from one to 9 are found before each hundred word and at the end of 90 words each.\n",
    "- the numbers 11 to 19 are found 10 times each.\n",
    "- the words twenty, thirty, etc are found 100 times each. "
