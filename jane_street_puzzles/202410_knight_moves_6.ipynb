    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick distinct positive integers $A$, $B$, and $C$, and place them in the squares below. Your goal is to create two corner-to-corner trips — one from a1 to f6, and the other from a6 to f1 — both of which score exactly 2024 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "A “trip” consists of knight’s moves. Squares may not be revisited within a trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “score” for a trip is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with $A$ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every time you make a move:\n",
    "    - if your move is between two different integers, multiply your score by the value you are moving to;\n",
    "    - otherwise, increment your score by the value you are moving to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you find positive integers $A$, $B$, and $C$, as well as a pair of trips, that satisfy the criteria above? How low can you get $A + B + C$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please format your entry by concatenating your values for $A$, $B$, and $C$, followed by your a1-to-f6 tour, followed by your a6-to-f1 tour. For example, “1,2,253,a1,b3,c5,d3,f4,d5,f6,a6,c5,a4,b2,c4,d2,f1” would be a properly formatted entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "To qualify for the leaderboard your value for $A + B + C$ must be less than 50.\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve the problem using backtracking. We loop through possible combinations of $A$, $B$ and $C$ and check if it is possible to find two paths scoring to 2024 with those values. Starting witht the smallest possible values for $A$, $B$ and $C$, we directly get the minimum possible value for $A + B + C = 6$."
