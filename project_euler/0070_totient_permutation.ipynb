    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$, and $8$, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, $\\phi(9)=6$.<br>The number $1$ is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\\phi(1)=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, $\\phi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$ is a permutation of $79180$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the value of $n$, $1 \\lt n \\lt 10^7$, for which $\\phi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$ and the ratio $n/\\phi(n)$ produces a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's product formula states that the totient function is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\phi(n) = n \\prod_{p|n}\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{p} \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the product is over the distinct prime factors dividing $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we are looking to minimize\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\frac{n}{\\phi(n)} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{p|n}\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{p} \\right)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "for some $n$ where $\\phi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the totient function and its inverse as find the prime factors of $n$ with a modified sieve of Eratothenes. We check if $n$ is a permutation of $\\phi(n)$ by comparing the sorted digits of both. If they match, we keep track of the minimum of $n/\\phi(n)$."
