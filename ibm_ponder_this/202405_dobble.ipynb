    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "DobbleÂ® is a card game in which each card contains eight symbols, and any two Dobble cards in the deck share exactly one symbol. A standard Dobble deck consists of 55 cards and 57 symbols. However, it is possible to have a deck of 57 cards and 57 symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, given a number $N$ , which is a prime power, it is possible to find a Dobble-like deck where each card contains N+1 symbols, and there are $N^2+N+1$ cards and symbols in the deck. Dobble itself corresponds to the case $N=7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal: For $N=4$, find the number of all possible Dobble-like decks with $N^2+N+1$ cards and symbols, and $N+1$ symbols per card, where each pair of cards has exactly one common symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bonus \"*\" will be given for finding the number of all possible Dobble-like decks for $N=8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dobble-like deck with parameter $N$ is equivalent to a projective plane of order $N$. The projective planes of order 4 and 8 are unique up to isomorphism. Given the number of symbols in the deck is $N^2 + N + 1$, and considering that permutations of the symbols which are automorphisms of the deck lead to indistinguishable (i.e., isomorphic) decks, the number of distinct decks is computed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\text{Number of distinct decks} = \\frac{(N^2 + N + 1)!}{\\text{Size of the automorphism group}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on projective plane theory, the size of the automorphism groups for the projective planes of order 4 and 8 are 120960 and 49448448 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the answer for $N = 4$ is $\\frac{21}{120960}$ and the answer for $N = 8$ is $\\frac{73}{49448448}$.\n"
