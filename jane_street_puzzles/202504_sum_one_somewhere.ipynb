    "For a fixed $p$, independently label the nodes of an infinite complete binary tree 0 with probability $p$, and 1 otherwise. For what $p$ is there exactly a 1/2 probability that there exists an infinite path down the tree that sums to at most 1 (that is, all nodes visited, with the possible exception of one, will be labeled 0). Find this value of $p$ accurate to 10 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P_0$ be the probability of obtaining a path summing to 0 startting from the root. The probability that the root is 0 is $p$. The probability that a given subtree contains a path summing to zero is $P_0$. Therefore, the probability that none of the subtrees contain a path summing to zero is $(1 - P_0)^2$. Finally the probability of obtaining a path summing to zero only is the intersection of the probability that the root is zero and the probability that at least one subtree sums to zero. Therefore, we obtain the equation\n",

    "    P_0 = p \\left[ 1 - (1 - P_0)^2 \\right].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the quadratic equation yields two solutions $P_0 = 0$ and $P_0 = 2 - \\frac{1}{p}$. Therefore, a strictly positive $P_0$ only occurs is $p > \\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P_1$ be the probability that there exists a path summing to at most 1. With probability $(1 - p)$ we end up in a situation where we must have a subtree summing to zero, similar to the $P_0$ situation above. With probability $p$, we are still in a position where a one is allowed. This gives the equation\n",
