    "# 171 - Square Sum of the Digital Squares\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For a positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the squares of the digits (in base $10$) of $n$, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "f(3) &= 3^2 = 9,\\\\\n",
    "f(25) &= 2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 = 29,\\\\\n",
    "f(442) &= 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the last nine digits of the sum of all $n$, $0 \\lt n \\lt 10^{20}$, such that $f(n)$ is a perfect square.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $n$ has at most 20 digits, the maximum value of $f(n)$ is $20 \\times 9^2 = 1620$. There are only 40 squares lower than this. For each of those squares, $s$, we can compute all the combinations of 20 squares (including 0) that sum to $s$. This can be achieved with a modified knapsack algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given combination, we need to find the of the last 9 digits for all the permutations. Let $m_0, m_1, ..., m_9$ represent the number of $0, 1, ..., 9$ in the digit combination. The total number of distinct permutations, $N$, is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    N = \\frac{20!}{m_0!m_1! \\cdots m_9!}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In each permutation, each of the 20 positions is equally likely to contain each digit (according to its multiplicity). This means that among the $N$ permutations, the number that have the digit $d$ in a specific position is given by \n",
    "$$\\frac{m_d}{20}N.$$ \n",
    "The contribution of all the digits for a specific position is the sum of the individual contributions given by\n",
    "$$ \\frac{N}{20} \\sum_0^9 dm_d. $$\n",
    "Finally, we need to consider the contribution for each of the last 9 positions in the permutation. The $i$-th rightmost contribution needs to be multiplied $10^{i-1}$. Therefore, for the last 9 digits, we need to multiply the contribution by $\\sum_{i = 0}^8 10^i = 111111111$. Based on this, we can compute the contribution to the total sum of the combination as\n",
    "$$ 111111111 \\frac{N}{20} \\sum_0^9 dm_d. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have everything we need. For each valid $f(n)$ we compute all the possible digit combinations and sum the contribution from each permutation of the digits. Finally, we apply modulo $10^9$ on the result to extract the last 9 digits."
