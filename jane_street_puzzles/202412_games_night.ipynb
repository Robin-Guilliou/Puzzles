    "Oh no! The elves in charge of board games only managed to complete a couple of sets before they were distracted by playtesting the toys. Ho-ho-ho-w infuriating!\n",

    "[The answer to this puzzle is a single word.]\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we can notice is that the items from each game form letters. We have\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uno: M\n",
    "- Catan: I\n",
    "- Risk: S\n",
    "- Monopoly: S\n",
    "- Dominon: I\n",
    "- Scrabble: N\n",
    "- Sushi Go: G\n",
    "- Chess: O\n",
    "- Clue: N\n",
    "- Stratego: E\n",
    "- Bananagrams: S\n",
    "\n",
    "When the games are taken in order as above, we see that the letters form the words \"MISSING ONES\". Then, we realise that for each game except monopoly and clue, there is a missing item:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uno: Yellow\n",
    "- Catan: Ore\n",
    "- Risk: Ural \n",
    "- Monopoly: /\n",
    "- Dominon: Silver\n",

    "- Chess: King\n",
    "- Clue: /\n",
    "- Stratego: Miners\n",
    "- Bananagrams: Y\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the first letter of each word and using a space for when no item is missing, we obtain \"YOU SUNK MY\". The word battleship would finish the sentence based on the Battleship game. Therefore, the answer is 'battleship'."
