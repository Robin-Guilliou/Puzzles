    "\n",
    "It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&4 + 1\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this using dynamic programming. For each base integer, we check in how many ways we can create each total amount from 1 to 100. For a given base integer, the number of ways to make some amount is equal to the number of ways to make the amount minus the base integer."
