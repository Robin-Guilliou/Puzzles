    "\n",
    "Then, we loop through all the values in row $n$ skipping multiples of 2. Note that we do not need to generate the full row, we only use the index in the row and the starting value of the row to generate the relevant numbers. When we find a prime number, we check for prime if the neighbours are prime in rows $n + 1$ and $n - 1$. Again, if a prime is found, we check the neighbours again to find the last element of the triplet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not necessary to loop through all the indices in the row and check if the corresponding value is prime. We could simply loop through the list of primes in the row. Also, all the checks could be conducted directly while generating the primes in the range."
