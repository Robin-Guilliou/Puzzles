    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call two triangles \"sibling pairs\" if they are two non-identical triangles with integer side lengths respectively $(a,b,c_1)$ and $(a,b,c_2)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the only side of each triangle with a different length from the other triangle, since there are two common side lengths $a$,$b$ **and** both triangles must have a common nonzero area.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is the pair of triangles with side lengths $(5,5,6)$ and $(5,5,8)$ . The area of both is 12. Another example is $(7,4,7)$ and $(7,4,9)$ with area $\\sqrt{180}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some $a$ and $b$ , there may not be any sibling pair at all (e.g., $a=3$ and $b=2$) and for some, there may be more than one. For example, if $a=24$ and $b=23$, three sibling pairs exist with the following side lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(24,23,19)$ and $(24,23,43)$, area = $\\sqrt{41580}$\n",
    "- $(24,23,23)$ and $(24,23,41)$, area = $\\sqrt{55440}$\n",
    "- $(24,23,29)$ and $(24,23,37)$, area = $\\sqrt{71820}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal: Find two integers $a$, $b$ such that $a>b$ and there are **exactly** 50 sibling pairs with common side lengths $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A bonus** \"*\" will be given for solving the above problem with the additional constraint that at least two of those 50 sibling pairs must have **integer** areas. The areas of the remaining pairs may be irrational.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For some sides $a$ and $b$ with $a > b$, there are always two triangles with the same area (one obtuse and one acute) and this area, $A$, is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    A = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin({\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin({180 - \\theta})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle in degrees between $a$ and $b$ in the acute triangle (and $180 - \\theta$ is the angle in the corresponding obtuse triangle). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ represent the sides of the two triangles with same area. From the cosine law, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    c_1 &= \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - ab\\cos(\\theta)} \\\\\n",
    "    c_2 &= \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + ab\\cos(\\theta)}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the second equation comes from the fact that $\\cos(\\theta) = -\\cos(180 - \\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $c_1$ is an integer only if $a^2 + b^2 - ab\\cos(\\theta)$ is a perfect square and $c_2$ is an integer only if $a^2 + b^2 + ab\\cos(\\theta)$ is a perfect square. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the above properties to restrict the range of $c$ values that we consider for a given $(a, b)$. We first precompute all the squares below $a_{\\text{max}}^2 + b_{\\text{max}}^2$ where $a_{\\text{max}}$ and $b_{\\text{max}}$ are the maximum values we will consider for $a$ and $b$. We do not need squares above $a_{\\text{max}}^2 + b_{\\text{max}}^2$ because this corresponds to a right triangle and we only need squares to generate acute triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given $(a, b)$, we loop through the squares in the range from $(|a - b| + 1)^2$ to $a^2 + b^2$. To avoid unnecessary computations, we identify the index of the first relevant square with a binary search. We set $c_1^2$ equal to the square we currently process and compute the corresponding $c_2^2$ value as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    c_2^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab\\cos(\\theta)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "    \n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c_1^2}{2ab}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If $c_2$ is an integer and $(a, b, c)$ form a valid triangle (i.e., no side is longer than the sum of the two other sides), we have found a sibling pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we generate $a$ randomly in the range 1 million to 50 million and generate $b$ as $ua$ where $u \\sim \\text{Unif}(\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. As python can be quite slow, we use numba to speed up the computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the tricks above, we manage to get a solution pretty quickly even when generating $a$ and $b$ randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the bonus, for each $(a, b)$ combination with exactly 50 sibling pairs, I tried computing the area of each triangle with high precision using Heron's formula, \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    A = \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ is the semiperimeter given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I could not find any integer area. I guess it would be necessary to use properties of Heronian triangles.\n"
