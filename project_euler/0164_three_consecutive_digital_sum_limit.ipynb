    "# 164 - Three Consecutive Digital Sum Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "How many $20$ digit numbers $n$ (without any leading zero) exist such that no three consecutive digits of $n$ have a sum greater than $9$?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved with dynamic programming. If we know two consecutive digits, say $d_2$ and $d_3$, it is straightforward to find the valid values for $d_1$, the digit that precedes them. We have $d_1 \\leq 9 - d_2 - d_3$. For the last two digits of $n$, there are 100 different choices from 00 to 99. For each of those, we generate valid values for the $d_1$ and we record the frequency at which we have $10 d_1 + d_2$. Once we have the frequencies, we have a new list of valid two digit numbers (new $d_2$ and $d_3$). We repeat the previous process and check the digit that can go before them. Everytime, we find a valid value for the first digit, we compute $10 d_1 + d_2$ and increase its frequency by the frequency of $10 d_2 + d_3$ found previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "After repeating this process 18 times, we can sum the frequencies of all the two digit combinations where the first digit is greater than zero."
