    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "An even positive integer $N$ will be called admissible, if it is a power of $2$ or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.<br>\n",
    "The first twelve admissible numbers are $2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N$ is admissible, the smallest integer $M \\gt 1$ such that $N+M$ is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $N=630$ is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime factors are the consecutive primes $2,3,5$ and $7$.<br> \n",
    "The next prime number after $631$ is $641$; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number for $630$ is $M=11$.<br>\n",
    "It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for $16$ is $3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the sum of all distinct pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible numbers $N$ less than $10^9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "First we can note that we do not need primes above 27 as the product of all primes up to 29 is greater than $10^9$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first generate the admissible numbers. We loop through the prime numbers up to 27 and multiply all the admissible numbers generated by the previous primes with the current prime. To account for multiplicities, we keep multiplying by the current prime until the result is above $10^9$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the admissibles numbers, we find the next prime (or next next prime if the difference is equal to one) and store the difference in a set to avoid dupplicates. Finally, we sum all the values in the set to obtain the answer."
