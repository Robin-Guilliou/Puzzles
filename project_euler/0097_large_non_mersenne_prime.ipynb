    "# Large Non-Mersenne Prime\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593} - 1$; it contains exactly $2\\,098\\,960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form $2^p - 1$, have been found which contain more digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2\\,357\\,207$ digits: $28433 \\times 2^{7830457} + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the last ten digits of this prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We first compute $2^{7830457}$ but only keep the last 10 digits by taking the modulo $10^{10}$. Then we multiply by 28433 and add 1 and take the modulo $10^{10}$ again."
