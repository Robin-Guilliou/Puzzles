    "# 92 - Square Digit Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&44 \\to 32 \\to 13 \\to 10 \\to \\mathbf 1 \\to \\mathbf 1\\\\\n",
    "&85 \\to \\mathbf{89} \\to 145 \\to 42 \\to 20 \\to 4 \\to 16 \\to 37 \\to 58 \\to \\mathbf{89}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.\n",
    "How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the sequence for each starting value and count the number that end in 89. We use memoization to avoid recomputing the sequence multiple times for the same $n$."
