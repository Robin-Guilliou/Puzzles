    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    " $F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that $F_{541}$, which contains $113$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital (contain all the digits $1$ to $9$, but not necessarily in order). And $F_{2749}$, which contains $575$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $F_k$ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital, find $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci numbers quickly get very large. Therefore some optimizations are necessary to get the result in a decent time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we note that checking the last 9 digits is easier than checking the first 9 digits. This is because we can compute the Fibonacci numbers modulo $10^{10}$ and avoid handling very large numbers. Therefore, we only check if the 9 first digits are pandigital if the last 9 digits are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need a way to efficiently extract the first 10 digits. The $n$-th Fibonacci number, $F_n$, can be generated using Binet's formula as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    F_n = \\frac{\\phi^n - (1 - \\phi)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is the Golden ratio. As $(1 - \\phi)^n$ approaches zero for large $n$, we can approximate the $n$-th Fibonacci number as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    F_n \\approx \\frac{\\phi^n}{\\sqrt{5}}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the base 10 logarithm on both side of the approximation, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\log_{10}(F_n) \\approx n \\log_{10}(\\phi) - \\log_{10}(\\sqrt{5}).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now obtain the first 9 digits with $\\left \\lfloor 10^{\\log_{10}(F_n) - \\left \\lfloor \\log_{10}(F_n) \\right \\rfloor + 8} \\right \\rfloor$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using those optimisations, we can generate consecutive Fibonacci numbers until we find one that fits the condition."
