    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad n^2 + n + 41$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the formula will produce $40$ primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \\le n \\le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by $41$, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by $41$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces $80$ primes for the consecutive values $0 \\le n \\le 79$. The product of the coefficients, $-79$ and $1601$, is $-126479$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering quadratics of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad$ $n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| \\le 1000$ and $|b| \\le 1000$\n",
    " \n",
    "$\\qquad $ where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$ <br>\n",
    "$\\qquad $ e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "First we note that $b$ must be a prime number because for $n = 0$, it is the only way to obtain a prime number. Apart from this, we generate all the combinations of $a$ and $b$ and count the number of consecutive $n$ values that generate prime numbers."
