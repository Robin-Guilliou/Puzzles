    "\n",
    "The cube, $41063625$ ($345^3$), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: $56623104$ ($384^3$) and $66430125$ ($405^3$). In fact, $41063625$ is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We generate all the cubes in order. For each cube, we sort the digits and count the frequency of occurrence of the sorted string and keep the corresponding cubes. When a value is found 5 times, the first cube corresponding to the sorted string is the answer."
