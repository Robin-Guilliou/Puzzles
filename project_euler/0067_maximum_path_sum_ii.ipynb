    "\n",
    "By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"monospace center\"><span class=\"red\"><b>3</b></span><br><span class=\"red\"><b>7</b></span> 4<br>\n",

    "8 5 <span class=\"red\"><b>9</b></span> 3</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.\n",

    "Find the maximum total from top to bottom in <a href=\"inputs/0067_triangle.txt\">triangle.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99</sup> altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as for Problem 18. Starting from the bottom of the triangle and going up, we add the max of the two next values to the current one."
