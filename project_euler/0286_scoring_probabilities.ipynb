    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance $x$ is exactly $(1 - x / q)$, where $q$ is a real constant greater than $50$.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each practice run, she takes shots from distances $x = 1, x = 2, \\dots, x = 50$ and, according to her records, she has precisely a $2\\%$ chance to score a total of exactly $20$ points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find $q$ and give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution of the number of successes in a series of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with potentially different success probability, $p_1, p_2, \\cdots, p_n$, is the Poisson binomial distribution. Here the number of trials is $n = 50$ and the probabilities are given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    p_x = 1 - \\frac{x}{q}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this probability distribution to compute the probability of 20 successes among the 50 trials given our $p_x$ values. Unfortunately, for such a large $n$, computing the PMF of the Poisson binomial distribution is not possible. Instead, we will use the discrete Fourier transform where the probability of $k$ successes is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    P(K = k) = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\sum_{\\alpha = 0}^n C^{-\\alpha k} \\prod_{x = 1}^n (1 + (C^\\alpha - 1)p_x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    C = \\exp \\left( \\frac{2i\\pi}{n + 1} \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we simply need to implement the function above, subtract 0.02 from the result and numerically solve for the root of the resulting function by changing the value of $q$. For the solver, we will use Brent's method as implemented in `scipy.optimize.brentq`. We arbitrarily choose a range for $q$ between 51 and 100. This can be updated if the root is not found."
