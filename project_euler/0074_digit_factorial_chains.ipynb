    "##Â Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The number $145$ is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to $145$:\n",
    "$$1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps less well known is $169$, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to $169$; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&169 \\to 363601 \\to 1454 \\to 169\\\\\n",
    "&871 \\to 45361 \\to 871\\\\\n",
    "&872 \\to 45362 \\to 872\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&69 \\to 363600 \\to 1454 \\to 169 \\to 363601 (\\to 1454)\\\\\n",
    "&78 \\to 45360 \\to 871 \\to 45361 (\\to 871)\\\\\n",
    "&540 \\to 145 (\\to 145)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with $69$ produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate the process with a recursive function and count the number of chains with 60 non-repeating terms. Memoization is important for efficiency."
